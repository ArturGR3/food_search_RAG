- move the prompts to a separate file with jinja templating
- think about scoring mechanism 
- test the negation prompts strategy  
 - consider creating a user prompts with negations for testing 
 - query preprocessing to avoid negation and then using LLM to preprocess the query  
 - check if hybrid search does better with the negation strategy 
 - check if fine-tuning the embeddings with the negation prompts helps
- consider to remove restrictions on the number of recipes returned, as long as the pass the relevance threshold
- fine tune prompt for relevance assessment (it seems it does not work well)    
- add a functionality that when the user hit enter while entering the user name it will start the session without the need to click on the login button
- make sure to move images `` mv data/Food\ Images/Food\ Images/* data/Food_Images/``
